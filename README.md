# PSRule

Validate infrastructure as code (IaC) and DevOps repositories using rules.
PSRule allows you to analyse a repository with pre-built rules or create your own.
Analysis can be performed from input files or the repository structure.

To learn about PSRule and how to write your own rules see [Getting started](https://github.com/microsoft/PSRule#getting-started).

## Usage

To get the latest stable release use:

```yaml
- name: Run PSRule analysis
  uses: Microsoft/ps-rule@v1.10.0
```

To get the latest bits use:

```yaml
- name: Run PSRule analysis
  uses: Microsoft/ps-rule@main
```

For a list of changes please see the [change log].

## Inputs

```yaml
- name: Run PSRule analysis
  uses: Microsoft/ps-rule@main
  with:
    inputType: repository, inputPath                        # Optional. Determines the type of input to use for PSRule.
    inputPath: string                                       # Optional. The path PSRule will look for files to validate.
    modules: string                                         # Optional. A comma separated list of modules to use for analysis.
    source: string                                          # Optional. A path containing rules to use for analysis.
    baseline: string                                        # Optional. The name of a PSRule baseline to use.
    conventions: string                                     # Optional. A comma separated list of conventions to use.
    outputFormat: None, Yaml, Json, NUnit3, Csv, Markdown   # Optional. The format to use when writing results to disk.
    outputPath: string                                      # Optional. The file path to write results to.
    path: string                                            # Optional. The working directory PSRule is run from.
    prerelease: boolean                                     # Optional. Determine if a pre-release module version is installed.
```

### `inputType`

Determines the type of input to use for PSRule either `repository` or `inputPath`.
Defaults to `repository`.

When set to:

- `repository` - The structure of the repository within `inputPath` will be analyzed.
- `inputPath` - Supported file formats within `inputPath` will be read as objects.

### `inputPath`

The path PSRule will look for input files.
Defaults to repository root.

### `modules`

A comma separated list of modules to use for analysis.

Modules are additional packages that can be installed from the PowerShell Gallery.
PSRule will install the latest **stable** version from the PowerShell Gallery automatically by default.
[Available modules](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=Tags%3A%22PSRule-rules%22).

To install pre-release module versions, use `prerelease: true`.

### `source`

An path containing rules to use for analysis.
Defaults to `.ps-rule/`.

Use this option to include rules that have not been packaged as a module.

### `baseline`

The name of a PSRule baseline to use.
Baselines can be used from modules or specified in a separate file.

- To use a baseline included in a module use `modules:` with `baseline:`.
- To use a baseline specified in a separate file use `source:` with `baseline:`.

### `conventions`

A comma separated list of conventions to use.
Conventions can be used from modules or specified in a separate file.

- To use a convention included in a module use `modules:` with `conventions:`.
- To use a convention specified in a separate file use `source:` with `conventions:`.

For example: `conventions: Monitor.LogAnalytics.Import`

### `outputFormat`

The output format to write result to disk.
Supported formats are `Yaml`, `Json`, `NUnit3`, `Csv`, `Markdown`.
Defaults to `None`.

### `outputPath`

The file path to write results to when `outputFormat` is configured.

### `path`

The working directory PSRule is run from.
Defaults to repository root.

Options specified in `ps-rule.yaml` from this directory will be used unless overridden by inputs.

### `prerelease`

Determine if a pre-release rules module version is installed.
When set to `true` the latest pre-release or stable module version is installed.

If this input is not configured, invalid, or set to `false` only stable module versions will be installed.

## Using the action

To use PSRule:

1. See [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).
2. Reference `Microsoft/ps-rule@main`.
For example:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze repository
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@main

    - name: Run PSRule analysis
      uses: Microsoft/ps-rule@main
```

3. Create rules within the `.ps-rule/` directory.
For example:

```powershell
# Example .ps-rule/GitHub.Community.Rule.ps1

# Synopsis: Check for recommended community files
Rule 'GitHub.Community' -Type 'PSRule.Data.RepositoryInfo' {
    $Assert.FilePath($TargetObject, 'FullName', @('LICENSE'));
    $Assert.FilePath($TargetObject, 'FullName', @('CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md'));
    $Assert.FilePath($TargetObject, 'FullName', @('CONTRIBUTING.md'));
    $Assert.FilePath($TargetObject, 'FullName', @('README.md'));
    $Assert.FilePath($TargetObject, 'FullName', @('.github/CODEOWNERS'));
    $Assert.FilePath($TargetObject, 'FullName', @('.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md'));
}
```

4. Run the workflow.
